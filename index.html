    <h1> Plushies Mod </h1>
    <p>Welcome to our Minecraft mods site. Here, you can find all the mods from Comette. </p>
    <p>For now, we only have one mod that includes plushies (3 so far). Each one has a different function, and we are going to introduce them to you.</p>
    <p>(These plushies are mainly made for decoration!)</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Bear Plushie</li>
        <br><br>
        
            <img src="bearC.png">
            <ul>
                <li>When you right-click on the Teddy Bear, it will disappear and leave a heart, which restores 50 health points if you right-click it in your main hand. If you break the bear, you will be able to collect it again. WARNING, breaking the Teddy Bear will not perform the same functions as the other plushies.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            
        <li>Squirrel Plushie</li>
        <br><br>
            <img src="squirrelC.PNG">
            <ul>
            <li>If you destroy the Squirrel Plushie with a left click, you will get a huge speed effect (with a slightly distorted screen), but a zombie will appear. This is useful for running away like a coward if your cousin is chasing you with full Netherite. If you right-click on the Squirrel Plushie, it will be collectible with heart particles around it</li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>

        <li>Penguin Plushie</li>
        <br><br>
            <img src="penguinC.PNG">
            <ul>

                <li>Now, we arrive at the last plushie of version 1.0.0 of the mod, the Penguin Plushie! If you place it, you will have the plushie on the ground (of course), LOTS of particles, but also a mini heart that gives the Absorption effect for a very short duration. The mini hearts stack up to a maximum of 5. If you right-click on this plushie, the Penguin Plushie will drop and also spawn a bee! </li>

            </ul>
